One web application that has stuck out to me was Burritos Banditos. 
The reason this stuck out to me as a really good website, was that my mom said it with ease. 
It flows really easily, its simple, and its really effective at ordering food.
No pesky app you have to download, just a simple website you can directly order from.


First off, you are greeted with red menu on top, which draws your attention. 
My main goal was ordering take-out online. So I hit the “Order online” button.

The next screen, brings up a map of locations near you that you can order from. 
On the left, you can click on which place you would like to order.

On the order screen, it gives and entire menu which you can click on the item you wish to order.

After you click on the item, it brings up another menu, which you can select what ingredients you want on the item.
After you selected that item, you can continually click on items you wish to order, till you are done.

On the checkout screen, it gives you options of when you would like to pick out the order, and if you would like to give a tip.
On the right, it gives you a box of what is on the order, and what is on each item.

To analysis it from a usability perspective, (effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, error tolerant.) I would say this is a really good web application. 
The first priority of this app I would say is being effective and efficient. The menus give you enough information to order without hiccups and it flows nicely. You are able to add and remove ingredients as you order with.
With the current pandemic it has the unintentional benefit of being safe in multiple ways. 
1.	You minimize your time in the physical location, if you don’t decide to use curbside pickup.
2.	Your credit card and personal information is safe to my knowledge. 
I would definably say this application is satisfying since I am able to get my order with very little hassle and I get a delicious meal at the end of it. It is useful in the aspect that it helps satisfy one of Maslow’s hierarchal needs. 

It is learnable, in the sense that I didn’t have to do that many steps to reach my goal.

 Its very easy to repeat, and since you get food at the end of it, it makes it very memorable because you associate food with the application.  Almost like classical conditioning if you think about it.

Its error tolerant because you can change your order easily without error, and very little mess-ups in the ordering process. 

Overall it is a fantastic application, and it helps achieve my goal of stratifying my hunger quite easily.
