#My second journal entry. 
Matthew Scheer

In my second journal, I decided to continue with the theme of terrible user experiences. This time I decided to do it on McGraw Hill's LearnSmart.

Learn smart is a program that is forced upon students so students can learn from home with a virtual book and assignments. 

Using that standard "effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, error tolerant" 

Starting off we are greeted with the book. As you can see, it's pretty heavy on information, since it is a book, but the menu and options do get awash in the application. To cut down on the information overload, they do grey out sections are that not deemed necessary.  On the left you can see the different sections for the chapter, and on the bottom you have options to navigate the sections as well, so you have a duplicate ways of navigating the chapter.

For this assignment I have to answer the questions, and read the section. 
To begin the questions of the assignment, you click the “practice” button on the bottom left side. To make it Obvious they have to button flash white/blue to get your attention.

After you start the “practice” you are greeted with a bunch of question ranging from 30-60 of them. They can be multiple choice like the one below or they have be fill in the blank, or “arrange type.”
To make it obvious after you select your answer, it becomes darker and a check mark appears. To submit your choice you have 4 buttons to choose from, assuming letting the system or the teach, know how much you think you know the reasoning for your choice.

After you submit your answer you are shown if you selected the correct or wrong answer.  A green rectangle or a red on appears around your selected answer. Then the total answers is decremented.

Once you are done with the assignment, you are greeted with a assignment completion screen. 

To analyze if it is effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, error tolerant.
To say if it is effective, you have to say what is goal is. That goal of learn smart is to have someone read the chapter and answer questions.  The problem with this is that you can go straight into the questions without reading the book and just mash answers till the assignment is completed. Sure, it works, but I say it poorly accomplishes the goals. 


Efficient, I would think not, but it does flow well and the application does run smoothly. 

Safe, yes since no personal information is leaked. And it doesn’t require personal information besides the initial purchase of the product. 

Satisfying, no. The product costs 145 dollars, and it feels like busy work. You are just answering questions, and most students don’t read the subject matter, they just google the answers and click the right answer. 

Learnable, I would say yes, since it is a fairly easy user interface and nothing to complicated. 

Memorable, the program is but the subject matter isn’t much so since the product does such a poor job of making you memorize it. 

Useful, I guess it would be a little useful and kind introduces you to the subject matter.

Error Tolerant, not much to say on that, there has been some issues in the past of wrong answers being the “current” ones, but they mostly fixed that.
