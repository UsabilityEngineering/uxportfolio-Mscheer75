A buggy menu mess of a game "Train simulator 2020"

When I saw Train simulator 2020 on the humble bundle for 1$, I was super excited. I made the hard choice and 
spent the 12$ to include most of the DLC with the game, as I was wanting to play one of the California maps in the game.
What I didn't realize was that the game was a nightmare of usability, which explains why it was only a dollar.

we first start off with the main menu, which is fairly simple and straight forward, you have your Profile, create a map, the Store, ETC. I just wanted to jump straight in and drive a train on a California route. So 
I hit the drive buttton.

And this is what I was greeted with:

Super confusing, convoluted and a labyrinth of buttons. My goal was to drive a train on a California route, but I see 4 options, Quick Drive, Career, Standard and Free Roam. I navigated to free roam.
When I clicked it, I was greeted with nothing, no way to select a route or a train. The filter was on "Show All Scenarios", but nothing was showing up. So clearly this was the wrong menu.

I navigated back to the menu menu and hit “Quick drive”, but all there was, was a random button. No way to choose what to drive. So much for "customize your experience". Just click and hope you get something you wanted. So I navigated to “Standard”.

What I was greeted with in “Standard” was a single route in Germany. Clearly this isn't California. Frustrated I just quit the game, and played something else.
