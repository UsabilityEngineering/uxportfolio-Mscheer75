A buggy menu mess of a game "Train simulator 2020"

When I saw Train simulator 2020 on the humble bundle for 1$, I was super excited. I made the hard choice and 
spent the 12$ to include most of the DLC with the game, as I was wanting to play one of the California maps in the game.
What I didn't realize was that this game was a nightmare mess of usability, which explains why it was only a dollar.

we first start off with the main menu, which is fairly simple and straight forward, you have your Profile, create a map, the Store, ETC. I just wanted to jump straight in and drive a train on a California route. So 
I hit the drive buttton.

And this is what I was greeted with:

Super confusing, convoluted and a labyrinth of buttons. My goal was to drive a train on a California route, but I see 4 options, Quick Drive, Career, Standard and Free Roam. I navigated to free roam.
When I clicked it, I was greeted with nothing, no way to select a route or a train. The filter was on "Show All Scenarios", but nothing was showing up. So clearly this was the wrong menu.

I navigated back to the menu menu and hit “Quick drive”, but all there was, was a random button. No way to choose what to drive. So much for "customize your experience". Just click and hope you get something you wanted. So I navigated to “Standard”.

What I was greeted with in “Standard” was a single route in Germany. Clearly this isn't California. Frustrated I just quit the game, and played something else.

Going over the concepts in class, effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, and error tolerant.

Was it “effective” in my goal? No, graphics were nice though.

Efficient? I had to click through 5 menus just to find out I couldn't play the California map I purchased.

Safe? For the most part, its a game, so nothing personal is stored on it.

Satisfying? Absolutely not. They could of at least have a pop-up saying I need to “complete XYZ” in order to unlock such and such map. Which I would understand, but having nothing is completely frustrating. It's a SIMULATOR, not some arcade game. Everything should be unlocked from the start.

Learnable? I would say it is, since the menu is consistent, and fairly easy to navigate, since you really only have one option.

Memorable? In the absolute wrong way it is. 

Useful? Well considering it is a game, in which you can't play the map you want to play, it isn't useful. I Would have a better time playing with google maps, and following the railroad tracks.

Error tolerant? No, It caused a buffer over flow and locked my computer the first time I was typing this out and locked me out of my computer. Terrible game, save your 1$ for a soda.
