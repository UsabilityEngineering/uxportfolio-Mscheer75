A buggy menu mess of a game "Train simulator 2020"

When I saw Train simulator 2020 on the humble bundle for 1$, I was super excited. 
I spend the 12$ to include most of the DLC with the game, as I was wanting to play one of the California maps in the game.
What I didn't realize was that the game was a nightmare of usability, which explains why it was only a dollar.

we first start off with the main menu, which is fairly simple and straight forward, you have your Profile, create a map, the Store, ETC. I just wanted to jump straight in and drive a train.
